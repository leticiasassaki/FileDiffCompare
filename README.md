# FileDiffCompare Project

This project is based on an idea of compare two files and give
an information about it. Initially it'll only response if the files are the same, but
 in a near future we may provide some more information, so, enjoy it ;)

## How to run it?

First thing first, before starting the project locally, you'll need some configuration.

- Install nodejs
- Install NPM
- Run ``npm install`` towards the project root folder
- Run ``node app.js`` in order to start the application
- Access the application ``http://localhost:3000``
